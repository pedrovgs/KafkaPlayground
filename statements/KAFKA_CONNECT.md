# Kafka connect

Reinventing the wheel is one of the most repeated tasks as engineers. But today we are going to avoid it. Kafka is really popular, and developers all around the world have been working hard to publish differnt Kafka consumers and producers as open source projects you can use. [This web](https://www.confluent.io/hub/) contains an index of all the connectors you can find. You'll see how these can be declared as source or sinks. Source connectors are equivalent to producers and Sink connectors are equivalent to consumers.

There is just one task for you as part of this exercise:

* Think in the last project you worked on and the database you used or any other third party storage system you needed at that time. After that, using the web already mentioned, find a connector for your database.
